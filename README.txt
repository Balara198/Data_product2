This Data Product is an experimental analysis for a university class.
The analysis aims to find visualize the ratio between the scientific and cultural advancement for each country, for each century. 
The goal was to create a world map-plot, where each country will be colored to a shade of purple. This color's red component is determined by the number of scentific advancement,
and the blue on by the cultural one. The plot has a slider which will let the user to change the century to be mapped.
My hypotesis (based on the hypotesis of Dr. Simonyi Károly in the book: "A fizika kultúrtörténete") was that the scientific and cultural advancements were developed together.

Sadly there was not suitable data to support the analysis, so I randomly generated them.

Here I've listed the files I used for this report, and their short descripton:

Data_product2/
├── CountryBounds.csv : Coordinates of the borderlines of each country to be used in the geopandas plotting.
├── CountryCodes.csv : Names and codes of the countries.
└── DP2.1.ipynb : The notebook, where the analysis has been implemented.
